- (a) For the training set: I cropped a random portion of the image and resize it to a given size (224x224), and then horizontally flipped the given image randomly with a given probability (p = 0.5). Finally, I normalized a tensor image with mean ([0.485, 0.456, 0.406] for each RGB channel) and standard deviation ([0.229, 0.224, 0.225] for each RGB channel).
For the validation and testing set: I resized the input image to the given size (256x256), and then cropped the given image at the center with size (224x224). Finally, I normalized a tensor image with mean ([0.485, 0.456, 0.406] for each RGB channel) and standard deviation ([0.229, 0.224, 0.225] for each RGB channel).

- (b) Loss function would be cross-entropy loss; optimizer would be Adam optimizer.

- (c) For the model with training a Resnet18 model from scratch, the number of epochs is 50 (because I reset all of the weights), and the number of epochs is 25 for the other 2 models. For all models, the batch size is 4 and the learning rate is 0.001

- the learning rate is decay by a factor of 0.1 every 7 epochs
