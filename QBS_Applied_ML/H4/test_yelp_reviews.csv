Would not recommend to others.
I will be back many times soon.
Their steaks are 100% recommended!
At first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe - nice ambiance, clean, friendly staff.
We waited an hour for what was a breakfast I could have done 100 times better at home.
We ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside.
Needless to say, we will never be back here again.
A good time!
"As for the ""mains,"" also uninspired."
It's like a really sexy party in your mouth, where you're outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party.
The service here is fair at best.
Very very fun chef.
Service was very prompt.
The food was delicious, our bartender was attentive and personable AND we got a great deal!
It was a bit too sweet, not really spicy enough, and lacked flavor.
Went for lunch - service was slow.
We recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well.
Highly recommended.
it was a drive to get there.
This place is amazing!
This is an Outstanding little restaurant with some of the Best Food I have ever tasted.
This wonderful experience made this place a must-stop whenever we are in town again.
The chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless, seemed thin and watered down with no heat.
I had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so I will not be getting that again.
This is a good joint.
It was probably dirt.
"I don't know what the big deal is about this place, but I won't be back ""ya'all""."
I love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes.
RUDE & INCONSIDERATE MANAGEMENT.
I've never been treated so bad.
What happened next was pretty....off putting.
Every time I eat here, I see caring teamwork to a professional degree.
I kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes, yet still no food.
The service was meh.
AVOID THIS ESTABLISHMENT!
will definitely be back!
On three different occasions I asked for well done or medium well, and all three times I got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate.
Their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place.
Ryan's Bar is definitely one Edinburgh establishment I won't be revisiting.
Extremely Tasty!
I ordered the Lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible.
I personally love the hummus, pita, baklava, falafels and Baba Ganoush (it's amazing what they do with eggplant!).
I love the decor with the Chinese calligraphy wall paper.
When I opened the sandwich, I was impressed, but not in a good way.
Stopped by this place while in Madison for the Ironman, very friendly, kind staff.
Cant say enough good things about this place.
I was disgusted because I was pretty sure that was human hair.
The last 3 times I had lunch here has been bad.
Definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly, will return next time I'm in Vegas.
I won't be back.
Great food and service, huge portions and they give a military discount.
The plantains were the worst I've ever tasted.
Worst Thai ever.
Will be back again!
-My order was not correct.
My friend loved the salmon tartar.
After all the rave reviews I couldn't wait to eat here......what a disappointment!
Everything was gross.
If you want healthy authentic or ethic food, try this place.
Best Buffet in town, for the price you cannot beat it.
I had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill, but unfortunately the taste fell flat, way flat.
I can assure you that you won't be disappointed.
And the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very tasty to me.
The turkey and roast beef were bland.
This was like the final blow!
We walked away stuffed and happy about our first Vegas buffet experience.
Good prices.
We made the drive all the way from North Scottsdale... and I was not one bit disappointed!
For that price I can think of a few place I would have much rather gone.
I did not expect this to be so good!
But I definitely would not eat here again.
This place lacked style!!
I could care less... The interior is just beautiful.
Based on the sub-par service I received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business I won't be going back.
If you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service, then this is the place for you.
And then tragedy struck.
This place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver.
Maybe if they weren't cold they would have been somewhat edible.
This is a great restaurant at the Mandalay Bay.
I will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone!
Ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes.
Just spicy enough.. Perfect actually.
The roast beef sandwich tasted really good!
My boyfriend and I came here for the first time on a recent trip to Vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service.
I hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives.
The only good thing was our waiter, he was very helpful and kept the bloddy mary's coming.
A great way to finish a great.
I LOVED their mussels cooked in this wine reduction, the duck was tender, and their potato dishes were delicious.
Great food for the price, which is very high quality and house made.
I liked the patio and the service was outstanding.
My boyfriend tried the Mediterranean Chicken Salad and fell in love.
Not good for the money.
We got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy.
My fianc√© and I came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away.
He was extremely rude and really, there are so many other restaurants I would love to dine at during a weekend in Vegas.
The menu is always changing, food quality is going down & service is extremely slow.
How can you call yourself a steakhouse if you can't properly cook a steak, I don't understand!
The food sucked, which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined.
It was a pale color instead of nice and char and has NO flavor.
There is nothing authentic about this place.
